# Lesson 9 Demo 3
Continuous Monitoring on Docker with ELK Stack


### Steps to be followed:
1.	Set up ELK stack on Docker
2.	Configure Jenkins pipeline for Docker build and deployment
3.	Run the Spring Boot application and check the logs in Kibana

### Step 1: Set up ELK stack on Docker





1.1	Download Docker compose file in one of the git repositories and follow the set of commands given below to initialize the ELK stack.


```
 su
git clone https://github.com/Siraj-ul-muneera/ELKExample.git
cd ELKExample
ls -alrt
 
```
 
1.2	Start the ELK stack using the docker-compose command. Usually, this binary is not installed on a server. So, follow the set of commands given below to install Docker Compose.


```
 apt install docker-compose
docker-compose version
 
```
 
1.3	Before starting the ELK stack, run the command given below so that elastic search is configured properly.

```
 
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144

```
 
1.4	Run the docker-compose command to initialize the ELK stack.



```
 docker-compose up -d
docker ps

```
  
 

 
1.5	Open the Kibana URL using the public IP of the host and 5601 port to access the Kibana dashboard.

http://localhost:5601/app/kibana

 

### Step 2: Configure Jenkins pipeline for Docker build and deployment
- 2.1	From the browser, navigate to http://localhost:8080 and login to Jenkins.
- 2.2	Configure your Docker hub credentials in Jenkins. Go to Manage Jenkins -> Manage Credentials -> click on Jenkins link -> click on Global credentials (unrestricted) -> click on Add Credentials from the left pane.
 
- 2.3	Add the details as shown below


```
 Username: <Your_DockerHub_Username>
Password: <Your_DockerHub_Password>
 
```
 
- 2.4	You should now see the credentials saved as shown below
 
- 2.5	Create a Jenkins pipeline job to fetch Jenkinsfile from the URL mentioned below.  

- 2.6	You can either use the below git repository or Fork it in your Github account and use it
https://github.com/Siraj-ul-muneera/ELKExample.git

- 2.7	Configure the job as shown in the screenshot below and then run the build. 

 
- 2.8	Give 777 permission to the Docker sock file since we are running Docker command from a Jenkins user.


```
 chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock

```
 
 
- 2.9	Build the Jenkins job to deploy the Docker container on the Docker host. 

- 2.10	Jenkins pipeline will complete the build and the deployment process for the Spring Boot application
 
 
- 2.11	We can see the Docker container deployed on the Docker host using the command:


```
 docker ps | grep springbootapp

```
 
 

### Step 3: Run the Spring Boot application and check the logs in Kibana

3.1	Access the Spring Boot web application and perform some random activity so that the logs will be pushed to ELK stack.

http://localhost:81
 
3.2	Check the logs pushed to ELK stack in Kibana.

3.3	Navigate to the Kibana dashboard. Select Management > Index Management from the navigation bar on the left. You can see the logs created.
